hello !  

I have a question for you? unseen in isotope
<li class = "example isotope-item" data-number = "31" style = "height: 350px; position: absolute; left: 0px; top: 0px; opacity: 1;-webkit-transform: translate3d (245px, 365px , 0px) scale3d (1, 1, 1); "> <a href="http://www.relentlessenergy.com/"> <img src =" https://s3.amazonaws.com/zootool.previews/ 18k3a/m.jpg? 1357231253 "> <b> Relentless Energy Drinks | Extreme Sports | Alternative Music - Relentless </ b> </ a> </ li>

But in chrome, I can see some of the procedures. How can I make changes in Dreamweaver.
Because learning needs, so I hope you can get your reply. thank you!
